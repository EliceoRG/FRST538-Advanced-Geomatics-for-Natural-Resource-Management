## Lab Overview {.unnumbered}

In this lab, you will be exploring a few different statistical approaches to modelling geographic data, including geographically weighted regression (GWR). GWR is the spatial extension of aspatial regression analysis and much more. Traditional regression analysis assumes that global statistics adequately describe local relationships that might exist in the data. For example, consider looking at the relationship between housing prices and the floor space, lot size, etc., of houses in the city of Vancouver. While we could develop a 'global' model that adequately describes the relationship between those variables, knowing what you do about housing prices in the city of Vancouver (e.g., that a house of similar dimensions, age, lot size, etc., in the east side of Vancouver will sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars less than an identical house in the west side of Vancouver), the utility of such a model when looking at neighborhood-level housing issues would be very doubtful. Nonetheless, for decades such models, such as hedonic models, have been normalized in real estate research.

Similarly, consider studying the relationship between rates of crime or diseases to environmental conditions, local conditions can be much more important than any global relationship that might be discovered via a traditional aspatial statistical approach. Using polygon or point data, GWR allows us to explore the local relationships amongst a set of variables and examine the results spatially using ArcGIS Pro. It should be noted that in R you can find more sophisticated approaches to GWR than what is provided by ArcGIS Pro.

In this lab, you will explore the equity of green space for the city of Vancouver using Landsat imagery and demographic data from the 2021 Canadian census.

Why is access to green spaces so important? Human well-being, including physical and psychological well-being increase when residents are exposed to green space and urban forests. In addition, ecosystem services provided from green spaces include improved air quality, urban heat island mitigation, and opportunities for recreation. Yet, there is unequal access to green spaces across urban landscapes. The distribution of green space is often disproportionately present in affluent communities. So, you will test the hypothesis that there is less green space in marginalized communities. We cannot infer any causal relationships, but we can examine the relationship between the location of green spaces and demographic variables.

Vancouver is the most populous city in British Columbia, Canada with a population of 662,248 in 2021. Vancouver is an ideal study site because of the city's high level of heterogeneity among its demographic and green space structure.

## Task 1: Visualize census data {.unnumbered}

Statistics Canada census data are distributed in tables. These data can be particularly challenging to work with because they span multiple geographical hierarchies (e.g., national, provincial, municipal, etc.), multiple dates (the Canadian census occurs every 5 years), many demographic dimensions (e.g., population, age, education, language, etc.), and there are an enormous amount of enumerated areas.

The smallest geographic unit that census data are enumerated over are known as Dissemination Areas (DA). Statistics Canada gives the definition:

> A dissemination area (DA) is a small, relatively stable geographic unit composed of one or more adjacent dissemination blocks with an average population of 400 to 700 persons based on data from the previous Census of Population Program. It is the smallest standard geographic area for which all census data are disseminated. DAs cover all the territory of Canada.

As of the 2021 Canadian census, there are 57,936 unique Dissemination Areas. Each Dissemination Area is described by 2,631 unique characteristics (total population, age, education, language, etc.). That is a whopping 152 million values for describing Canadians! Lucky for us, we will be working with DAs for Vancouver, British Columbia and only a handful of characteristics.

The census data that you have been provided with for this lab, available from the course management system, are the result of collating the values of some select characteristics from this massive census database for just the dissemination areas that cover the city of Vancouver. The characteristics are summarized in the table below:

| Characteristic                                                                   | Units                        | Name                   |

**Step 1:** Open a new ArcGIS Pro project and add the **vancouver_da_characteristics.shp** data to your map.

Take note of the coordinate reference system for these data. Why might Statistics Canada distribute data in this projection?

**Step 2:** Open the symbology for the layer and switch "Primary Symbology" from "Single Symbol" to "Graduated colors". Then pick a census characteristic from the drop-down menu for "Field" and play around with the symbology. Repeat this across all the characteristics listed in the table above. 

```{r 06-vancouver-2021-popdensity, out.width= "100%", echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/06-vancouver-2021-popdensity.png")
```

As you practice visualizing the various characteristics, make some observations and use your own knowledge about how green space in the city of Vancouver is distributed to develop some hypotheses that describe the relationship between these characteristics and green space. Which of these characteristics do you think will be more important or less important for describing the distribution of green space in Vancouver?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 2: Practice geographically weighted regression {.unnumbered}

In this task, we are going to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of each dissemination area in Vancouver and then select characteristics from the census data that explain the local variation in vegetation greenness, as expressed by NDVI. So the census characteristics are going to be our independent (explanatory) variables $k$ and the calculated statistics of NDVI are going to be the dependent (response) variable $y_i$ for our geographically weighted regression:

$$
y_i=𝛽_0(u_i,v_i)+\sum_{k}^{}𝛽_𝑘(u_i,v_i) 𝑥_{𝑖𝑘}+ε _𝑖
$$

$𝛽_0(u_i,v_i)$ is the local model intercept at position $(u_i,v_i)$

$𝛽_k(u_i,v_i)$ is the local coefficient (slope) of the $k$-th independent variable (census characteristic) at position $(u_i,v_i)$

$𝑥_{𝑖𝑘}$ is the local $i$-th observation of the $k$-th independent variable (census characteristic)

$ε _𝒊$ is the local error term (residual) for the $i$-th prediction

You have been provided two geotiffs, **LC08_L1TP_047026_20200814_20210330_02_T1_B4.tif** and **LC08_L1TP_047026_20200814_20210330_02_T1_B5.tif**, of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images representing bands 4 (visible red) and 5 (near-infrared), respectively. These images were acquired on August 14, 2020, which is approximately when the 2021 census data were collected.

**Step 1:** Add the Landsat images to your ArcGIS Pro project. Open the "Raster Calculator" tool and calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and save the output in your project geodatabase simply as "ndvi":

$$
NDVI=\frac{Band5-Band4}{Band5+Band4}
$$

```{r 06-arcgis-ndvi, out.width= "100%", echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/06-arcgis-ndvi.png")
```

**Step 2:** Now we need to summarize the NDVI values over the dissemination areas. Open the "Zonal Statistics as Table" tool and use "vancouver_da_characteristics" as the "Input raster or feature zone data", select "alt_geo_co" as the "Zone field", use "ndvi" as the "Input value raster", and name the "Output table" as "ndvi_zonal_statistics". Ensure that "Statistics type" is set to "All", leave the other fields as default and run the tool.

```{r 06-arcgis-zonal-statistics, out.width= "75%", echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/06-arcgis-zonal-statistics.png")
```

This will produce a table that should look like the image below. The table contains summary statistics of NDVI calculated for each dissemination area. Now we need to join this table to the polygon feature class.

```{r 06-arcgis-zonal-statistics-table, out.width= "75%", echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/06-arcgis-zonal-statistics-table.png")
```

**Step 3:** Right-click on the "vancouver_da_characteristics" layer in your Contents Pane and select "Joins and Relates", then "Add Join". The "Input Table" is "vancouver_da_characteristics" and the "Join Table" is "ndvi_zonal_statistics". Select the correct keys to join the tables. This is a one-to-one join. Map the output, below is an example of average NDVI.

```{r 06-arcgis-ndvi-mean, out.width= "100%", echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/06-arcgis-ndvi-mean.png")
```

It is important to initially analyze our census characteristics $k$ to determine which independent variables and combination of these variables have the strongest relationship with our dependent variable, NDVI $y$. To conduct the initial analysis, we will use a tool called "Exploratory Regression", which is part of the Spatial Statistics Toolbox.

**Step 4:** Open the "Exploratory Regression" tool. Select "vancouver_da_characteristics" as your "Input Features" and "ndvi_zonal_statistics.MEAN" as your dependent variable. Select all of the census characteristics as your "Candidate Explanatory Variables", expand "Search Criteria" and change the "Maximum Number of Explanatory Variables" to 14 then run the tool with other fields as default.

```{r 06-arcgis-exploratory-regression, out.width= "50%", echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/06-arcgis-exploratory-regression.png")
```

_NOTE: Some fields were truncated when we saved the "vancouver_da_characteristics" shapefile. It should still be apparent which fields to select, but some of the original names will not perfectly match._

**Step 5:** When the tool has finished running, click "View Details" at the bottom and then click "Messages". Under the heading "Highest adjusted R-squared results", you can explore the modeled relationship between one or more independent variables and the dependent variable. You should see the adjusted R-squared plateau at 0.41 when using a model with seven independent variables. We can use the statistics like Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc), Jarque-Bera p-value (JB), and Max Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to choose between similar models with different sets of independent variables. Be sure to copy-paste this output message to a notepad so that you can reference it later in your report.

```{r 06-arcgis-exploratory-regression-results, out.width= "100%", echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/06-arcgis-exploratory-regression-results.png")
```

**Step 6:** Once you have selected a model, write down the independent variables that are used in the model. Open the "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)" tool. The "Input Feature Class" is "vancouver_da_characteristics", "Unique ID Field" is "vancouver_da_characteristcs.alt_geo_co", name the "Output Feature Class" as "ols_mean_ndvi", set the "Dependent Variable" to "ndvi_zonal_statistics.MEAN", and then select all of the independent variables that you wrote down from the last step. Run the tool, then click "View Details", select "Messages", and copy-paste the output to a notepad to reference it later in your report.

```{r 06-arcgis-ols, out.width= "50%", echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/06-arcgis-ols.png")
```

**Step 7:** Open the "Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)" tool and parameterize it the same as you did in the last step for OLS, but change "Neighborhood Type" to "Number of neighbors", change "Neighborhood Selection Method" to "Golden search", and set "Minimum Number of Neighbors" to 50 and "Maximum Number of Neighbors" to 250. Name the "Output Features" as "gwr_mean_ndvi". Again, select all of the independent variables that you wrote down from earlier then run the tool. The output will automatically be added to your map along with several charts. Doubling-clicking on a chart will open it.

```{r 06-arcgis-variable-chart, out.width= "100%", echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/06-arcgis-variable-chart.png")
```

**Step 8:** Repeat steps 4-8, but this time choose two NDVI statistics other than MEAN (e.g., minimum, maximum, standard deviation, etc.).

**Step 9:** Explore your GWR results and make maps of the following for each of the three different NDVI statistics that you will reference in your report: 
- Standardized residuals 
- Local R\^{2}

**Step 10:** Explore your GWR results and make a map of one "Coefficient" and one "Std.Error" for one of your independent variables. Reference these maps when you are explaining your results in your report.

**Step 11:** Answer the following questions in your report and refer to all the maps, tables, and figures you made in the previous steps:

-   Compare and contrast the different NDVI statistics. Which statistic had the best model? What evidence do you have for that conclusion? Why do you think that relationship was the strongest?
-   Interpret one of your independent variables in one of your three NDVI statistics using the Std.Error and Coefficient map. What spatial patterns do you see? What do you think could be influencing this relationship?
-   What other factors (spatial or aspatial) might be contributing or confounding your analysis? In other words, what other data sources might you add/calculate or what methods might you change to improve your results?
-   What can you conclude about green equity among dissemnination areas in Vancouver?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary {.unnumbered}

Geographically weighted regression can be a powerful tool for exploring spatial relationships. It takes some care and practice learning to interpret the many statistics along the journey, but it is one of the statistical methods that is rewarding to map and visualize. You should think of geographically weighted regression as a first approach at looking at a problem. It is great for exploring relationships, but not necessarily testing them. As you have seen, geographically weighted regression is a wonderful way to generate spatial hypotheses about data and explore the underlying tendencies of different relationships. Along the way, you have also learned how to wield high-dimensional census data in a database. Census data pair well with a wide variety of spatial analyses once you have decoded and unlocked their spatial mysteries.
